Currently, 12 annotation reference tracks exist for the human transcriptome in the UCSC genome browser [38]. Eight of these (UCSC, Refseq, CCDS, Vega, Ensembl, Aceview, Gencode, and LincRNAs) are based on empirically-observed EST or RNA-Seq data [24, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45]. The remaining four annotation tracks (N-Scan, Genscan, SGP, and GeneID) are algorithm-based, generated by scanning the genome for transcription start/stop sites, splice junction signals, etc. [46, 47, 48, 49, 50]. Many studies that aim to characterize novel features often do so with only a subset of these annotation tracks [19, 20, 23, 51, 52, 53]. For our study, we chose an inclusive approach and built a non-redundant reference transcriptome from the 8 empirically-determined annotation tracks. This reference transcriptome consists of 412,785 unique transcripts (unique CDS start and stop) and over 1 million exons (Additional file 1). We chose not to include the algorithm-based annotation tracks because of their unknown biological relevance.
